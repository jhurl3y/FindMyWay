Android Application for GPS-Based Autonomous Wheelchair System

This code is part of my final year project in Electronic and Computer Engineering in NUI Galway, Ireland. The aim of this project is to design a GPS-based autonomous system for wheelchair users. I have built a prototype system (not an actual wheelchair) to test the feasibilty of such a system (see below).
