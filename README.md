Android Application for GPS-Based Autonomous Wheelchair System
-

This code is part of my final year project in Electronic and Computer Engineering in NUI Galway, Ireland. The aim of this project is to design a GPS-based autonomous system for wheelchair users. I have built a prototype (not an actual wheelchair) to test the feasibilty of such a system (see pictures below).

The Android Application communicates with a Bluetooth server running on a Raspberry Pi Model B+ on the main chassis. See the following [repository](https://github.com/jhurl3y/wheelchair_nav/tree/master) for details on how to construct the physical system (note I will include schematics, drawings and a guide on how to do this once the project is complete). 

A lot of functionality is offered in the app. The user can specify a GPS point to travel to and manual control the system via a joystick interface. See screenshots below of app functionality.
